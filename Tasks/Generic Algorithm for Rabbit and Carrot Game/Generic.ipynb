        "\n",
        "You are given a board game where a rabbit has to collect as many carrots as possible on the board. The board has different types of cells, such as empty cells, carrot cells, obstacle cells, and trap cells. Consider the rabbit can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right. Additionally, the rabbit has a limited number of moves and a limited amount of energy. The rabbit loses energy when it moves or hits an obstacle. The rabbit gains energy when it eats a carrot. The rabbit dies if it runs out of energy or falls into a trap.\n",
        "\n",
        "Your task is to design and implement an algorithm to solve this game: a `genetic algorithm`. You should explain your approach clearly and justify your choices of parameters, operators, constraints, or heuristics. You should also provide a critical analysis of the algorithms, pros and cons, performance metrics, strengths and weaknesses, with previously implement `BFS`, `DFS` and `A*` and their suitability for this game.\n",
        "\n",
        "You should submit your code and a report that documents your algorithms and your analysis. Your report should follow the submission guidelines provided by the instructor. Your code should be well-commented and readable.\n",
        "\n",
        "This assignment will test your understanding of genetic algorithm, as well as your ability to apply it to a real-world problem. You will also demonstrate your skills in problem-solving, programming, and writing.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Input:**\n",
        "The input for the game is a board that represents the environment where the rabbit and the carrots are located. The board is a two-dimensional grid of cells, where each cell can have one of four types: empty, carrot, obstacle, or trap. The board also specifies the initial position and direction of the rabbit, as well as the number of moves and the amount of energy that the rabbit has. The input can be given as a text file, a graphical user interface, or any other suitable format.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Outputs:**\n",
        "The output for the game is a sequence of actions that the rabbit should take to collect as many carrots as possible on the board. Each action can be one of four types: move up, move down, move left, or move right. The output also shows the final state of the board, the rabbit, and the carrots after executing the actions. The output can be displayed as a text file, a graphical user interface, or any other suitable format."
