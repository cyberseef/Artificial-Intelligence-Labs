    "<h3>Scenario</h3>\n",
    "<p>This code calculates the remaining number of bananas a camel has after a journey given the total number of bananas, the distance to be traveled, and the maximum load capacity of the camel. It takes inputs, keeps track of the remaining bananas after each iteration, and stops when there are no more bananas left. The final result is the number of bananas the camel has at the end of the journey.</p>\n",
    "<p>The code takes inputs for the total number of bananas at the start, the distance to be covered, and the maximum load capacity of the camel. Then, it initializes a variable lose to keep track of the number of bananas lost in each iteration of the loop and another variable start to keep track of the remaining bananas at the end of each iteration.</p>\n",
    "<p>The loop iterates for the given distance, and in each iteration, the start value decreases in each iteration of the inner while loop until it becomes less than or equal to 0. The number of bananas lost in each iteration is updated and the new start value is calculated. The loop continues until the start value becomes 0. Finally, the value of start is printed, which represents the number of bananas that the camel has left after the journey.</p>\n",
